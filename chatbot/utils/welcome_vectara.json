Vecrata is built on a solid **hybrid search** core to enable better generative outcomes. Traditional search technologies focus on keywords, which limit their ability to understand complex queries. Vecrata deploys advanced **zero-shot** models and **conversational search** capabilities to understand, interpret, and respond to user queries with remarkable precision. Vectara summarizes search results on complex queries while providing factual citations from your data. Vecrata provides the best hybrid search core and superior language understanding for ingestion and retrieval. Vecrata can become your answer engine. "
